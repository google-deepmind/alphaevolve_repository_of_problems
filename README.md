# Mathematical Problem Repository for AlphaEvolve

This repository accompanies the manuscript

> Bogdan Georgiev, Javier Gómez-Serrano, Terence Tao, Adam Zsolt Wagner -- Mathematical exploration and discovery at scale, 2025

which is [available on the arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02864).  Specifically, the repository contains a webpage corresponding to each of the
problems considered in the manuscript, along with multiple Google Colab
notebooks corresponding to many (not all) of the problems. Each notebook
contains the prompt, verification code, and initial program used to launch the
AlphaEvolve experiments, along with the final evolved programs and
visualization / analysis code where appropriate.

This repository does *not* contain the code to run AlphaEvolve.

## A Collection of Mathematical Problems

The repository currently contains 67 mathematical problems whose descriptions
are available in the problems directory.

The n-th problem in the collection is available at:

https://google-deepmind.github.io/alphaevolve_repository_of_problems/problems/{n}.html

E.g. an autocorrelation problem related to Sidon sets (Problem 2) is:

## Distribution of Results

The current problem status is summarized in the following graphic:
