Formally, for every point x in F_q^2, there must exist a direction vector v in F_q^2 setminus 0 such that the set x + t cdot v : t in F_q, t neq 0 is a subset of N.\n",

This set has a magical property related to lines, making it a \"Nikodym set.\" The key to building a small, efficient Nikodym set is to first build its complement (the set of points not in it) and then take everything else.\n",

        "Conceptual Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "We will work with a special number system called a \"finite field,\" which we'll call F_q. Think of it as a grid of numbers where q = p^2. The construction has three main stages:\n",

An easy way to think about these numbers is as 2D vectors (a, b) where a and b are integers from 0 to p-1. We'll represent a number x in F_q as x = a + b*α, where α is a special symbol.\n",

        "The finite field Nikodym problem asks for the minimum size of a Nikodym set in a vector space over a finite field. Your goal is to find Nikodym sets in F_q^2 that are as small as possible, where q=p^2 for a given prime p.\n",
        "\n",
        "A set N subseteq F_q^2 is a Nikodym set if, for every point x in F_q^2, there exists a line l passing through x such that the \"punctured line\" l setminus x is entirely contained within N. Formally, for every point x in F_q^2, there must exist a direction vector v in F_q^2 setminus 0 such that the set x + t cdot v : t in F_q, t neq 0 is a subset of N.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your task is to write a Python function, search_for_best_construction, that directly returns a proposed Nikodym set.\n",
        "\n",
        "The input to your function will be:\n",
        "\n",
        "p: The prime number for the base field F_p. The full field is F_q where q=p^2.\n",
        "d: The dimension of the vector space, which will be fixed at 2.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function must return:\n",
        "\n",
        "A NumPy array of shape (k, 2, 2) representing the k points in your proposed Nikodym set N. Each of the k points has 2 coordinates in F_q. Each coordinate from F_q is represented as a pair of integers from F_p.\n",
        "\n",
        "How Your Function is Used:\n",
        "\n",
        "Your function directly produces the set N. An external function will then verify if your returned set is a valid Nikodym set by checking the condition for every point x in the space F_q^2.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your Goal and Evaluation:\n",
        "\n",
        "Your goal is to define the set N in such a way that it has the smallest possible size (cardinality k) while still being a valid Nikodym set.\n",
        "\n",
        "Your function will be evaluated based on the negative size of the resulting set N. A smaller set results in a less negative (i.e., higher) score. If your function returns an invalid Nikodym set, it will receive a very large penalty.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hint: You must find a general construction that works well for various primes p. The optimal construction misses around p^3 - C * p^2 * log p points from the entire (F_q)^2, meaning the Nikodym set has size p^4 - p^3 + C * p^2 * log p. This is what you should aim for. First try to find a construction of size p^4 - c * p^3, and once you have this, try to go for the optimal value of p^4 - p^3 + C * p^2 * log p. The \"normalized_score\" you are seeing for p=29 is the size of the complement. Once you are on the right track and the complement will be cubic, this score should be above 10000 (or very close to it). The optimal construction of size p^4 - p^3 + C * p^2 * log p will have a score of above 20000 for p=29.\n",
